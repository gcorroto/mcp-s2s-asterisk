```

### üíØ Tips for Effective Use

1. **Be specific with your requests**:
   - Include the project, board, and list names when referring to cards
   - Use the exact names of cards, lists, and boards

2. **Use natural language**:
   - You don't need to use specific command syntax
   - Claude will interpret your intent and use the appropriate MCP commands

3. **Chain related actions**:
   - You can ask Claude to perform multiple related actions in a single request
   - Example: "Create a new card called 'Fix bugs' in the 'To Do' list and add three tasks: fix login bug, fix navigation bug, and fix form validation bug"

4. **Track your time**:
   - Use the time tracking features to monitor how long you spend on tasks
   - Ask Claude to start/stop timers as you work on different cards

5. **Ask for help**:
   - If you're unsure about what commands are available, ask Claude for help
   - Example: "What kanban commands can you use?" or "How do I create a new card?"

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### üìÜ Using Kanban MCP for Project Management

The Kanban MCP tools can be integrated into your development workflow:

1. **Sprint Planning**:
   - Create a new board for each sprint
   - Set up lists for "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", and "Done"
   - Create cards for all planned tasks with detailed descriptions
